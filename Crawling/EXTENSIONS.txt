1. Domains beyond Amazon.com
- My crawler could be modified for domains beyond Amazon somewhat easily. Assuming that we have the same goal of pulling product details off of
a webpage, we would just need to change the starting URL and the intermediate paths that lead us to the product page. Once on the product page,
I would just need to write new functions with logic specific to those products. The process of gathering links and navigating to the right ones
doesn't really change too much with a different starting domain.

2. Product beyond just simply books
- My crawler could very easily be modified for Amazon products beyond just books. It would just be a matter of changing the category variable
in the getPageLinks() function to the path of the category you want. Then, I would have to write new logic for those products to gather the
product details.

To run my web crawler, simply do the following:

    npm install
    node crawler.js

All results will be output to products.json file.
